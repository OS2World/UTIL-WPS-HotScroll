Reversed History
================

+ New! lucky!
- Changed
* News

1.1 November 29, 1998
---

- Patched the ESC key that made dialogs disappear in the PM Loader.

+ New Timer Scrolling (like in StarOffice 5.0)
+ New, the Mouse Pointer can be changed while Hot Scroll is active.
- Loader.exe not updated.


1.0  February 14, 1998
---

- Fake Instant Redraw -> Fake Dynamic Scrolling
- Due to shared memory limitations, loader.exe now needs to be kept running
  to use it with Hot Scroll.

+ Hot Scroll can now be set differently for different applications.  For
  example, this means that you can Fake Dynamic Scrolling for DeScribe and
  FaxWorks, but not for VIEWDOC.EXE, or enable non-proportional scrolling
  for certain programs only.

+ And Hot Scroll can also be disabled for any application.
+ Fake Dynamic Scrolling now intercepts all scrolling messages.
  It also works properly with more applications.
+ New option to enable horizontal or vertical scrolling only.

* Bad News, didn't get hand manipulation to work.

* Good news!!  I think I found a way to make "hand manipulation" scrolling
  a reality, and also maybe a way to be able to follow the size changing
  slider on the scroll bars. Check for next version...

- Mouse leash now stops at border end, so that the scrolling won't seem to
  sink in a black whole. That was HARD to design. I hope you'll enjoy it.

- Speed changed to percentage.

+ A cute new PM interface for those who wants to use it.
+ Reserved Scrolling option added.


0.70  January 21, 1998
----

- In Scroll Lock mode, the scrolling position now follows the mouse
  position.  This means that for example, that the constant change of
  scroll bar ranges while browsing won't be a problem anymore.

- Fixed bug with the help screen showing mouse leash always off.

- The options now toggle if no - or + is given.

+ New non-proportional mode.
+ New no focus lock option for scroll lock mode.
+ New fake instant redraw feature.

* Oh, what do you know... I was not the first one to do this kind of
  program.  Warp Enhancer 0.25 has that feature also, but I tried it out and
  here what comes out of it:
     - You can only use MB3.
     - Horizontal scrolling doesn't work.
     - Has no sense of proportions.  Gets difficult to scroll large and
       small ranges.
     - Does not continue scrolling in the original window when the mouse
       pointer isn't over it anymore.
  Thanks to Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch> for pointing it out.

+ New scrolling speed option.
+ New mouse leash option.
+ Ability to use a lot more keyboard/mouse combinations.
+ Parameters are now saved in HOTSCRL.INI.
- Now checks for the owner of the scroll bars instead of just their
  parents.  ProNews/2 now half works.
